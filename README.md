Flexbox
Now that we have learned the power of flexbox we will apply it to the sites we are building. We'll also go back to a past assignment and see how flexbox would simplify our HTML and CSS.

Objectives
Build on your knowledge of HTML & CSS
Use flexbox techniques layout pages.
Implement, from scratch, a given design
Understand HTML/CSS Layout
Be able to place elements on a page where you want them.
Requirements
You should strive to implement the design as close as possible, though, especially if you've never touch HTML or CSS before, this can be extraordinarily difficult and will take a lot of practice and mileage.

Note: You should complete at least the tasks given for explorer mode as listed below before turning in the assignment, as well as before attempting adventure or epic modes.

Explorer Mode
Revisit your Serving HTML to table 5 assignment and redo your CSS using flexbox where appropriate. Add, commit, and push those changes to your existing repository.
